INTERACTIVE MODE
D 	      //Initialize ckts[] to safe defaults
M         //Change mode
s         //Display switch state
E         //Save data in ckts[] to EEPROM
e         //Load circuit data from EEPROM
P         //Program values in EEPROM ckts[] to ADE
T         //Set report interval in seconds
t         //Read report interval in seconds
R         //Hard Reset using watchdog timer
S         //Toggle channel circuit
L         //Run calibration routine on channel

C         //Change active channel for ADE, switching, and metering
p         //Measure circuit values and print

Debugging and Testing
A         //Write to ADE Register
a         //Read ADE reg
f         //Quick diagnostic test of basic functionality
F         //Test switch aggresively
o         //Wait for zero-crossing
x         //Wait for interrupt specied by interrupt mask
X         //Read waveform data 
z         //Read out results from test
Z         //Start switch and metering test

METER MODE
CMD CKT VALUE
M Change to meter or interactive mode with 2 or 1 respectively.
m Return mode
S switch circuit on or off (1,0)
s return state of circuit
T change reporting interveral in seconds
t read reporting interval in seconds
W meterAll circuits
w meter a particular circuit
! do nothing
