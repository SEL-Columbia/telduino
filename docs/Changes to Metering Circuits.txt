Changes to be made to the Metering Circuits
===========================================

1. Add ferrite bead to the voltage sensor lines?
2. We need to increase the voltage divider ratio. We have not accounted for the fact that we were thinking about RMS voltages when we used the 500K to 1K ratio.
	1. What we need is that the ratio is 1000K to 1K
3. We also want to use a filter with a higher corner frequency. right now, the corner frequency is 4 kHz. This seems close to our band of interest of 40-2khz. The internal low-pass filter has a corner frequency of 140 Hz. having an attenuation of 10 kHz would be beneficial to having a linear range across the frequency range of interest.
