Current is CH 1
Voltage is CH 2


Settings:
IGAIN = 0x01



Calibration:
Turn on integrator on MSB for CH1OS
ENABLE Line Accumulation Mode and Line Accumulation Interrupt
ENABLE CYCMODE to enable linecycle interrupt and set LINECYC to number of half cycles before interrupt
For any readings must wait until a zero crossing is detected and then read


Two Voltage and Current points gives us CHXOS
CH1OS = 0x80  + magic number determined by a two point calibration
CH2OS = another magic number determined by a two point calibration


Once CHXOS is set set WAGAIN and WGAIN according to give expected value for LVAENERGY and LAENERGY.

Set Minimum load.
