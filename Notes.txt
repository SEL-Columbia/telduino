OVERALL TODO:
- Must send byte to SD Card after raising CS according to: http://elm-chan.org/docs/mmc/mmc_e.html
- Standarize on success = 0
- Fix build environment
- make initialization naming conventions sane
- fix the shift register naming conventions
- Write generic code for switches
- Write code to lighup mount light
- Verify microsecond timing for SPI

BUILD
- There is a strange linking problem with prescaler.h that occurs if the default ADERegs are not consts. This also occurs with other modules as well.

SD
- For reliabilty the SD card should be run at a lower speed in the Khz range.
- The raw library seems to assume availability of the SD card. It is imperative that we make sure that the Ronald Reigel library doesn't cache writes and try to write when we are communicating with the ADE.
- Pins must be changed in sd_raw_config.h PL2 is used for the SD card SS. Therefor SS must be changed and the select/unselect functions.
- Additionally, as the 1280 uses the same SPI ports as the 128(?) I added a simple #define which configures the ports similarly. I might be wrong about that though.
- The lock (WP) and available(Card detect) pins must also be set to: 48/49 PL1,PL0 and the must also be configured nicely.
- When the switch is flipped the AtMega should synchronize the data and make sure that the card is ready to be unmounted.
- Should wrap Riegel's calls so that no accidents happen. Perhaps select/unselect should be rewritten to use CSselectDevice in select file.
- The biggest problem in getting the Reigel Library working is getting it linked
- Forgot to call the init routine!

ADE
- How does the ADE handle gettin an 8-bit 2s complement number for a 6 bit register?
- Need to convert 2s complement into signed magnitude numbers 
- Need to error check input ranges before sending to ADE

Docs
- Use Doxygen to automatically generate documentation
- Create patches for Ronald Reigel Libraries which specify used ports for select, available, and locked.

LOGGING:

QUERYING:
- make sure that any variable length operations have a timeout built-in.

Doxygen Basics:
- http://www.agapow.net/programming/all-the-rest/doxygen-cheatsheet is a good guide for the basics
- file must have /** @file */  at the begining to document the file.
- Long block of documentation, which can be put before the item being documented.
	/**
		Long description, usually but before function.
	*/
- Long block of documenation, which can be put at the same line as the item being documented.
	/**<    Long description, at the same line as, for instance, a variable.
- /** @warning Warning message */
- /** @todo ToDo message */
- see: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html for more information.
- A cheatsheet has been placed in the ...Berkeley_Docs/ directory.


ARCHITECTURE
(TODO pull data out of Rajesh's code)

ADE7753
SHiftRegister
Demux
SDRAW -> SDFAT32
Debug
	- Manages LEDs
	- Manages Serial Debug
Accounts
	- tracks energy credits
	- account status (FreePlay,Calibrating,PriceMode(i.e. DAY,NIGHT))
	- pricing models
Circuits	
	- manages each circuits state	
		- enabled/disabled
		- current/power limits
		- switching
	- tracks uncharged energy

//There's a circular dependency for the below functions so perhaps they should be integrated.
//Perhaps the QueryEngine should have a set of recurrent query jobs that are completed after a time interval.
Logger
	- Formats data from some QueryEngine functions and writes it out
	- Manages SD Card and Buffer if the card is disconnected.
	- Takes timestamp, type, string, [id]
QueryEngine 
	- Aggregates data from Logger, Circuits, and Accounts
	- Formats for GSM or logging
	- Sends to GSM, logger
