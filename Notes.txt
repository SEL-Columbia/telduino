Serial2 is the debug serial it is available from the arduino libraries.

SD
- The raw library seems to assume availability of the SD card. It is imperative that we make sure that the Ronald Reigel library doesn't cache writes and try to write when we are communicating with the ADE.
- Pins must be changed in sd_raw_config.h PL2 is used for the SD card SS. Therefor SS must be changed and the select/unselect functions.
- Additionally, as the 1280 uses the same SPI ports as the 128(?) I added a simple #define which configures the ports similarly. I might be wrong about that though.
- The lock (WP) and available(Card detect) pins must also be set to: 48/49 PL1,PL0 and the must also be configured nicely.
- When the switch is flipped the AtMega should synchronize the data and make sure that the card is ready to be unmounted.

Docs
- Use Doxygen to automatically generate documentation
- Create patches for Ronald Reigel Libraries which specify used ports for select, available, and locked.


Doxygen Basics:
- http://www.agapow.net/programming/all-the-rest/doxygen-cheatsheet is a good guide for the basics
- file must have /** @file */  at the begining to document the file.
- Long block of documentation, which can be put before the item being documented.
	/**
		Long description, usually but before function.
	*/
- Long block of documenation, which can be put at the same line as the item being documented.
	/**<    Long description, at the same line as, for instance, a variable.
- /** @warning Warning message */
- /** @todo ToDo message */
- see: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html for more information.
- A cheatsheet has been placed in the ...Berkeley_Docs/ directory.
