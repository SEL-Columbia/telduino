Serial2 is the debug serial it is available from the arduino libraries.

SD
- The raw library seems to assume availability of the SD card. It is imperative that we make sure that the Ronald Reigel library doesn't cache writes and try to write when we are communicating with the ADE.
- Pins must be changed in sd_raw_config.h PL2 is used for the SD card SS. Therefor SS must be changed and the select/unselect functions.
- Additionally, as the 1280 uses the same SPI ports as the 128(?) I added a simple #define which configures the ports similarly. I might be wrong about that though.
- The lock (WP) and available(Card detect) pins must also be set to: 48/49 PL1,PL0 and the must also be configured nicely.
- When the switch is flipped the AtMega should synchronize the data and make sure that the card is ready to be unmounted.
- Should wrap Riegel's calls so that no accidents happen. Perhaps select/unselect should be rewritten to use selectSS device in select file.

Docs
- Use Doxygen to automatically generate documentation
- Create patches for Ronald Reigel Libraries which specify used ports for select, available, and locked.


Doxygen Basics:
- http://www.agapow.net/programming/all-the-rest/doxygen-cheatsheet is a good guide for the basics
- file must have /** @file */  at the begining to document the file.
- Long block of documentation, which can be put before the item being documented.
	/**
		Long description, usually but before function.
	*/
- Long block of documenation, which can be put at the same line as the item being documented.
	/**<    Long description, at the same line as, for instance, a variable.
- /** @warning Warning message */
- /** @todo ToDo message */
- see: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html for more information.
- A cheatsheet has been placed in the ...Berkeley_Docs/ directory.


ARCHITECTURE

ADE7753
SHiftRegister
Demux
SDRAW -> SDFAT32
Debug
	- Manages LEDs
	- Manages Serial Debug
Accounts
	- tracks energy credits
	- account status (Free,Calibrating, )
	- pricing models
Circuits	
	- manages each circuits state	
		- enabled/disabled
		- current/power limits
		- switching
	- tracks uncharged energy

//There's a circular dependency for the below functions so perhaps they should be integrated.
//Perhaps the QueryEngine should have a set of recurrent query jobs that are completed after a time interval.
Logger
	- Formats data from some QueryEngine functions and writes it out
	- Manages SD Card and Buffer if the card is disconnected.
	- Takes timestamp, type, string, [id]
QueryEngine 
	- Aggregates data from Logger, Circuits, and Accounts
	- Formats for GSM or logging
	- Sends to GSM, logger

TODO:
    - make initialization naming conventions sane
    - fix the shift register naming conventions
    - Write generic code for switches
    - Write code to lighup mount light

Notes on SD Card
	Forgot to call the init routine!
Notes on ADE
	Seems to spout out gibberish, but it is at least talking.
	Need to make use of data member in ADEReg


Notes on build:
There is a strange linking problem with prescaler.h that occurs if the default ADERegs are not consts.

ToDo:
	- Check level translator lines
	- Fix build environment
	- Determine SD Card mode
	- Standarize on success = 0
